## Problem Statement

- In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data such as wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. This file was taken from a wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey.
- The objective was to model typical performance of the wind turbines, removing outliers and anomalies which would impact the model fit
- The final model uses a Radial Basis Function kernel on a Support Vector Machine
