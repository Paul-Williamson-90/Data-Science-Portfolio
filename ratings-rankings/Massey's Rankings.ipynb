    "## Advantages\n",
    "This method does not require that every team plays the same number of games, as other methods do. It also automatically incorporates ties, as it does not utilize whether a team won or lost, but rather the point differential, so ties are already accounted for, unlike other methods that count teams’ wins and losses. \n",
