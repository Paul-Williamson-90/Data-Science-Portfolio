## Problem Statement

- The AWID data set contains simulated examples of normal and intrusive 802.11 traffic with a variety of cyber threats/intrusions simulated in a physical lab, emulating a small office/home (SOHO) infrastructure.
- The reduced data contains 152 attributes and 1 target, of which some are useful for detecting attacks, some just noise [7]. The training set has 97,044 observations, the testing set 40,158
- The objective of the assignment was to research feature extraction techniques and develop a machine learning solution to detect impersonation attacks on resource-constrained devices.
